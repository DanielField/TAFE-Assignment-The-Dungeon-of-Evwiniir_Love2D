# The Dungeon of Evwiniir (Love2D)
2D maze game written in lua with LOVE2D. It is written for touch screen, keyboard, and/or mouse input.

This game was written for an assignment, and I just decided i'd upload it.

There are a few things that don't really work well in the game, but they were necessary to meet the criteria for the assignment.

NOTE: Saving the settings does not work on the compiled version. Not sure why... If anyone has a solution let me know. :)
